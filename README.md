<h2>Where should the csv's be stored?</h2>
First of all the path of the dataset files should be like:
'../Project1_Data/data/MERGED2000_01_PP.csv'
that is the files should be stored in a folder named 'Project1_Data', which further has a folder named data inside which all the csv files are stored.<br>
The '../Project1_Data' indicates that 'Project1_Data' folder should be one directory back relative to the folder in which you store/run the 'institution.ipynb'.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Pandas should be installed</li>
  <li>Numpy should be installed</li>
  <li>Plotly python package should be installed for interactive graphs</li>
</ul>

<h2>What's the project about</h2>
This prject aims to do a comphrehensive <b>exploratory data analysis</b> on the education dataset of the universities in United-States from the year 2010-2020.<br>
It aims to answer the question on why the disparity between Ivy-League Plus colleges and non-Ivy League Plus Colleges is bad for students, why non-Ivy League Plus universities lag behind their Ivy-League-Plus counterparts and what steps can they take to bridge the gap.
<br><br>
